## Future Work

* This iteration of my porftolio feels too static. Add fade in animations for elements scrolling into view.

* Use the GitHub API to load the projects instead of having three hardcoded projects.

* A certificate section.

* Endorsements section.

* New iterations could have an even simpler layout than this.

* Lazy loading.
